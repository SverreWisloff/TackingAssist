# TackingMaster
_A sailing-app for Android_

## Purpose

This is a simple app for Android phones that provides useful information for sailboats that do not have wind instruments.
Set wind direction and read close-hauled direction, course over ground and speed.
Observe wind turns and speed-changes, and see the consequences and make good decisions.

## Use

The direction where the wind comes from is always facing up, and the top number is the direction against the wind-eye. The blue "N" shows the direction to north. The yellow dot, and gray boat show your course over ground direction.

In the center circle, course over ground is displayed in yellow. The green number is speed. 

-5 and +5 buttons can be used for adjusting the wind direction with 5 degree increments.

The tack angle is defined to 90 degrees.
